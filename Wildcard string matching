Given two strings wild and pattern where wild string may contain wild card characters and pattern string is a normal string. Determine if the two strings match. The following are the allowed wild card characters in first string :-

* --> This character in string wild can be replaced by any sequence of characters, it can also be replaced by an empty string.
? --> This character in string wild can be replaced by any one character.
Example 1:

Input: wild = ge*ks
       pattern = geeks
Output: Yes
Explanation: Replace the '*' in wild string 
with 'e' to obtain pattern "geeks".
Example 2:

Input: wild = ge?ks*
       pattern = geeksforgeeks
Output: Yes
Explanation: Replace '?' and '*' in wild string with
'e' and 'forgeeks' respectively to obtain pattern 
"geeksforgeeks"


def isMatch(wild, pattern):
    m, n = len(wild), len(pattern)
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Fill the first row
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if pattern[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if wild[i - 1] == pattern[j - 1] or wild[i - 1] == '?':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            elif wild[i - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] or dp[i][j - 1]
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
wild = "ge*ks"
pattern = "geeks"
result = isMatch(wild, pattern)
print("Yes" if result else "No")
